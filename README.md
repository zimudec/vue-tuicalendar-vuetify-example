# Vue.js with Vuetify, Tui Calendar + Extras example project

This implementation is based on the complete [example of Tui Calendar + Extras](https://nhnent.github.io/tui.calendar/latest/tutorial-example01-basic.html) which is made in Html, CSS, Vuetify, Javascript and jQuery. Npm modules are used instead of using script tags in html.
